#Items

* ###1) Continuing Education/Training/Conferences/Teaching 
	* a) I’d like to continue data science courses this fall and possibly some short courses when possible.
		* 1) Mobile Dev Bootcamp at General Assembly $65, 
			* possibly Mobile Development track in 2016 after Data Science Cert., see Mobile Dev below, 
		
	* b) Conferences
		* 1) [PyData - Seattle](http://seattle.pydata.org/)
			* ($150 as student, $250 - 300 as individual. 
			* Plus airfare ($300-500)
		* 2) I’d like to consider FOSS4G or FOSS4G - North America in 2016, 		

	* c) Teaching	
		* 1) reached out to Gina two weeks ago about what I need to do to set up a GIS workshop in Brazil around June, July, August.
		* 2) I've had offers to instruct at Pratt SAVI and may do so after completing the Data Science certificate.  

* ###2) Scoping & Estimating projects and Work Queue 
	* Managing up, down and across to better deliver projects/data in the next year.

* ###3) Salary and Professional Development 
	* Unless any catastrophes with the Algorithms course or Machine Learning, I’m dedicated to completing the Data Science Certificate program thru May 2016 and after that would love to keep growing with BEH while maintaining a match of salary to skill set and work/life balance. If Columbia can’t cover salary increases to match my skill set and experience, I think the time I spend helping graduate students and other unfunded work that exceeds the standard workweek might be better well spent doing more paid outside work, instruction and freelance work. 

* ###4) specific projects/requests;
	* a) Developing a GPS cleaning python module - this would align with a few projects and think could contribute this to the open source stack as only a complicated .NET solution exists that snap/clean with OSM data. 

	* b) Getting the BEH GIS NYC Data portal up and running w/ D3 - I think this really needs to be scheduled in as a small project, its not a crazy amount of work, but it demands time for full-on attention. And I think I could handle doing this in D3 after learning it in my course.

	* c) Setting up a PostGIS back-end environment - For these larger data projects, it would be useful to set aside some time for developing a PostGIS backend production environment for geoprocessing. NAAS grid (84,000 100m grid points buffered at 5 distances with crazy overlap), NETS, GPS projects, could all greatly benefit from PostGIS. I’ve been integrating more and more GDAL/OGR and other open-source stuff into my workflow and its returns on processing data quicker are really worthwhile. This could also be a lead-in to developing a tool that would allow users to create PostGIS tables of x,y's and then run geoprocessing scripts w/ SQL in a more automated fashion. If we weren’t concerned about data security, this would be super easy to do on CartoDB. So another, maybe preferable, option is to chat with the folks at CartoDB about setting up a HIPAA/IRB compliant CartoDB stack. 

	* d) Variable-name Standardization huddle - For getting further along with the data portal and just to standardize things across the board at BEH, I’d like to set aside some time where James and I can spend a few days really hammering down a BEH standard variable naming convention. We’ve talked about this on the phone for like an hour last week and both agree it would be worthwhile. This is something we could have/should have done a year or two ago. Now that we’ve developed a better handle on all these new ACS releases, we might even be better equipped to take this on. I’m not sure when James can be in NY or will have the time to Google Hangout or whatever, but I think 8-12 hours or so would get us to a really great place for standardizing variable names (at least for demographic data to start). We’d also generate some code to make it easier to crosswalk pre-standard variable names to BEH standardized (this last bit is required for the BEH GIS NYC Data portal anyway). 

	* e) Hardware - I’ve accumulated a lot of large data files working on a few projects since adding a few new drives last year and archiving older projects. I’m not totally sure about backing everything up on the server (not all BEH folder members having IRB clearance for all projects on my drives, and general concern about its reliability and ability to retrieve backups). I think 2 4-TB thunderbolt drives would be good for 2015-2016, especially if we plan on working on any more NETS or big data projects. 

	* f) Software - My 4 CartoDB accounts (dif. emails) were at full capacity in March so I purchased an higher Academic account (next one up from the free tier). I’ve been paying $42.47 per month (~$117 with $10 credit for March) since March. If its possible I’d like to get some support for this cost. 

	* g) Mobile Dev - More long term (2-3 years), would like to think about developing for mobile devices for data collection and Apple’s ResearchKit specifically. 

* ###5) Feedback
	* I’d also like to hear more from you both about what James and I could be doing to help better facilitate getting more projects and completing projects efficiently. Perhaps it could also be useful to establish specific milestones over the next year.
