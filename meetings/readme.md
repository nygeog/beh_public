Thank for this, Danny. As Garazi (who’s sitting across from me) just said, they look great!  And the app to facilitate the systematic social observation is well above and beyond anything expected.  It’s going to make the field data collection on the RdP environment much smoother than we had thought, which is good since there are already so many logistics for Garazi and Renata to manage (which amazingly seem to be coming together), in addition to basically teaching the interviewers full time this week.
 
I’m nervous about the grid points being up for an extended period without any password to access them, since they’re so close to our recruitment points.  Garazi has grabbed screenshots of this which we’re carrying into the field, so I think we could take it down, or better yet, password protect.  We’re taking notes anyway about the outside of the building, and taking photos, so it would be simplest now that we’re including a larger segment of the team here just to take paper notes on any deviation between the assigned point location and selected recruitment site.  We can then fix them in fulcrum as a batch back at the office while we’re pulling together photos.
 
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you.  We’re working to get at least a no cost extension from Medtronic, and will try to figure out if we have additional funds to cover your efforts on this.
 
Obrigada,
Gina

Hey Danny, 

This looks awesome! Thanks so much!!! I have a lunch break tomorrow from 12-1 your time or i'll finish the training around 3 your time. Let me know if you'd like to chat during either of those periods. 

The sample points will be different from the street segment questions - the sample points are to identify the buildings and then launch the field teams. Unfortunately none will be "complete" prior to next week. The first would theoretically be complete on either Tuesday or Wednesday, March 24-25. 

The only thing we might want to discuss is the connection between the sample point and grid layer. Gina was out in the field today mapping points and thought that dropping new points might be redundant because the gps dot is a rough approximation anyway (you almost always have to pan across 1-2 streets to get to your location) in which case it might not matter if we do this in the field or do this back in the office. The street segment app and the photos app looks great. I'll try to include photos in the street segment section as well while im walking around but the photos will be a good interface for everyone else who isn't doing the street segment questions. 

Thanks again for putting so much time into this. I think it's going to work really well! 

Best,
Garazi

Recently Completed:

* Wrapped up Transit Project reprocessing 
* and NAAS geocoding (76 hours) on Friday. 
	* Low Estimate

			>>> 1370 * 3
			4110
			>>> 4110/60. 
			68.5 hours estimate

	* High Estimate

			>>> 1370 * 5
			6850
			>>> 6850/60. 
			115.167 hours estimate


* Monday/Weekend - GPS testing (see Rio Das Pedras below)

To Do:

* Findley Estimate (plan to spend next 2 days working on that) - Priority #1

* NAAS Geoprocessing 
* Restaurant Mapping
* BEH master dataset (met with Andrew RII this morning)
* NYC crime data scraper
	* Have 2013 and 2014 by month. Maybe 1-2 days of inspecting and building database.
		 
* What is my percent effort for the Rio project? 

###Rio Das Pedras

* iGotU GPS test:
I tried to carry it all weekend. Friday went down to Crown Heights and then Saturday went to NJ. None of the Saturday trip was captured.  [Here’s my GPS data in a map](http://cdb.io/1zIoM5U)

	* Here’s the time range:
		* 2015-02-13T23:31:28Z
		* 2015-02-14T16:13:59Z

* Field Staff GPS data collection:

	* I just built a CartoDB viz app (~1 hour) that allows for data collection/geotagging and so long as we get the users to have free accounts they can easily add points to a map. They would just need reliable cell service. The locational settings on the cell phone’s don’t need to be super precise as the user can pan and zoom on the map. I put those points on the map using my iPad today. It is much easier to scale this up and we could improve the interface as the project goes on. 

	* [Rio Map](http://dms2203.cartodb.com/viz/596a42a6-b5fd-11e4-adb0-0e0c41326911/embed_map)

* Rio Computer Details:
	* Are the computers hard drives encrypted (if we need to follow Columbia’s IRB protocols)? 
	* Will we have administrative access on them? 
	* Will we be able to log into them via SSL? If so will they have static or dynamic IPs? Being able to log in and share the screen with the GIS staff in Rio will be very helpful to ensure data collection. 


* What is my percent effort on this project? 


---

###NAAS 

* Shooting from the hip, as there was not formal time estimate for this project, I think it'll take about a month to create the neighborhood-level variables.


My understanding is that the next step (from our 10/10/14 email) is calculating a limited set of GIS variables around the successfully geocoded addresses: population density (2000 and 2010 census), % poverty (2000 and 2010 census), median household income (2000 and 2010 census), % park land, traffic volume, and black carbon and PM2.5 two-year averages from NYCCAS. The buffer sizes we agreed on were 0.25, 0.5, and 1-km radial buffers, plus 1-km network buffers. As I mentioned on the phone, we are hoping to add tree canopy (0.5-km radial buffer) to that list. Gina mentioned to me that it might actually save coding time to calculate tree canopy for the same set of buffer sizes you're using for the other GIS variables rather than picking out a specific buffer size -- so we're happy to do it that way if it saves you time to loop through buffer sizes!

* sent maps out for Dr. Hirsch and Morgan Flake

log-in cprc hours. 

-----###Working on:
####SPARCs* Creating ZIP + 4 for 2000 geocoding data for SPARCS* Need to create <strong>Time Estimate</strong> for Gina
####NAAS
* Started processing the grids. There's ~85,000 grid points. The 1 km buffers have had some serious code modifications as the overlapping polygons were causing the scripts to crash. The overlapping nature of the buffered grid points just don't process well unless subset and overlaps split out. ####Streetview DC
* A 1-km grid laid over the DC metropolitan area with an oversample on a 1/2-km grid anywhere where the 1/2-km grid would fall in the top quartile of residents age 50 or over (this is the sampling frame of the HRS). Plus 30 locations in the Baltimore metropolitan area for a training dataset. Grid must start at White House address (see Mike's notes in project folder)
	* Mike - get back with Census year	
######Answer:
######2010 Census. 
	* What is the plan for Baltimore, just random points? 



####Sally Findley

##2014-11-18
####Brooklyn Hospital Center
* If we need some web maps [CartoDB and Mapbox examples](http://scriptogr.am/nygeog)
* MXD of Brooklyn Hospital Center, with Crime, Crashes, Restaurants, etc. 

* Community Epi Profiles
	
	* Traffic Patterns
	* Profiles for geographies as small as possible (blocks, tracts?)
	* Develop a needs index
		* What are the neighborhood health needs?
		
	* Help patients, utility of the health profile. 

####Questions
* What is the catchment area of BHC? 

####SPARCS
* We currently don't have a ZIP + 4 dataset. It might be in Business Analyst but will have to rebuild Rundle-008 (machine that Noelle was using when it crashed.)

####CPRC 
* Creating maps for State Policy & Latino Health

####NAAS
* Started processing the grids. There's ~85,000 grid points. The 1 km buffers will need some serious code modifications as the overlapping polygons are slowing down a lot of the processing (to a halt in some cases ~4 days vs. a few hours for one operation).
* Traffic data, have an MXD to show

####Streetview DC
* A 1-km grid laid over the DC metropolitan area with an oversample on a 1/2-km grid anywhere where the 1/2-km grid would fall in the top quartile of residents age 50 or over (this is the sampling frame of the HRS). Plus 30 locations in the Baltimore metropolitan area for a training dataset.
	* Mike - get back with Census year

###GIS
####Tree Pollen/New York City Neighborhood Asthma and Allergy Study (NYC NAAS)
* Received addresses from Kate Weinberger last week. 
* Had a conference call about the variables to create for the project. 
* I'm going to begin geocoding in next few weeks.
* Kate will work on solidifying the list of GIS variables I'll be creating. 
	
* #####Kate's Variables for NAAS

	* 1) Danny maps the 45 pollen sites on top of aerial imagery, Kate checks for accuracy (done)

	* 2) Danny calculates a series of GIS variables for (a) the pollen sites and (b) a grid* across NYC. These variables are:
	- Tree canopy (2010 layer)
	- Building density
	- Elevation
	- Distance to nearest body of water
	- Traffic density**

		The buffer sizes we will need for these variables are 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1-km radial buffers

	* 3) Kate develops land use regression model and kriged surface using the variables calculated by Danny in #2

	* 4) While Kate is working on the LUR and kriging, Danny geocodes the home and school addresses for NAAS subjects

	* 5) When Kate is done with the LUR and kriging, Danny calculates GIS variables around the NAAS subject addresses. These variables are:
	- Population density (2000 and 2010 census)
	- % poverty (2000 and 2010 census)
	- Median household income (2000 and 2010 census)
	- % park land
	- Traffic volume***
	- Black carbon and PM2.5 two-year averages from NYCCAS (Danny, Gina said you would have this data)

		The buffer sizes we will need are 0.25, 0.5, and 1-km radial buffers plus 1-km network buffers. 

		At this point we will also need to use the surface Kate develops to calculate pollen exposures for the NAAS addresses. 

####MSM
* have all of the vector analysis completed, ran the kernel densities this weekend. 
* complete all the kernel density table operations, just need to run and slightly modify the code to compile all the tables into a master dataset and review the output before sending. 
* I need James to create the vacancy metrics and the updated walkability




####NETS
* created a NETS animation of modified healthy food outlets. 
	* This category includes supermarkets, fruit and veggie markets, natural food stores, and fish markets. This indicator of healthy food access was developed for a BMI analysis, and has been modified slightly to include nut stores and fish markets for a fatty acids focus - if SMK=1 or FVM=1 or NAT=1 or FSH=1 
	
	* Here’s a smaller version.

[For Viewing Online](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36281098/beh/nets/animation/nets_modified_healthy_half.gif)
	* And here’s a smaller one with a longer time period for each yearly snapshot.

[For Viewing Online](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/36281098/beh/nets/animation/nets_modified_healthy_half_longer.gif)

#####Suggestions

Create just an animation of the kernel densities. 

Maybe try the search radius at 1/2 km instead of 1 km. 

Half households have car use a diff. search radius. 

Try physical.

Try in R. with Shiny. 

Show a new location opening. Colored by date of entry. 

Animated GIF Studio. 

Try scale with all 23 counties. 


####Restaurants
* Review restaurants paper. 

* Tanya shared some links:

	* [State health agency workforce shortages and implications for public health: a case study of restaurant inspections in Louisiana](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24437047)
	* [Examination of the association between announced inspections and inspection scores.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24073484)
	* [Impact of internet posting of restaurant inspection scores on critical violations.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23858661)

* 1) I should be receiving a set of addresses at 11:30 am today from Kate Weinberger for geocoding. This is in regards to the tree pollen study. This includes additional addresses to the enrollment address, which James geocoded (James total n is 588.), and school addresses.
	 * 350 other addresses. School addresses and post enrollment address. 45 monitoring sites. 
* 2) Kate will be sending out a wish list of variables.
	Tree, Traffic, Census, ask about Walkability, etc. NAAAS
* 3) Will we be getting the Black Carbon dataset (from NYCCAS) by a finer time interval (month/week) or should we just use the 2-year avg? #
	* point nearest to hoem

####MSM
* 4) Called up James yesterday, he created the jittered point shapefile. The jitter is a random point within the bounds of the tract the point fell in. Jamie Eagan did the map, so I’ll fire off a quick map to Bader.  
* 5) Started processing the dataset for MSM. Conservatively, early next week the file will be completed and ready to send out. 

####NETS
* 6) I’m going to also be creating some NETS maps for an animation of kernel densities of healthy food outlets this week. 

####GPS
* 7) Still have 1-2 full days of working on the GPS walks data. 

####Transit

* 8) Downloaded a few census variables about vehicle ownership

	* Since the 1990 data from the US Census is difficult to obtain. The data used in this part of the project was obtained from Social Explorer (access provided by Columbia University). 
	* No auto ownership for 1980 and 1990 and 2000 for Social Explorer (check US Census website). 1970 had 15% tables (not sure what these are).

	* Got Vehicle Ownership data from 2000 Census and 2008-2012 ACS. 

####Walkability Comments
* Rochdale/Locust Manor seems to be the biggest change. 

####Misc
* [Woods Hole US Biomass] (http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=f7535ebbb05b4eaf8ef019dbeb42be19)
This map represents year 2000 baseline estimate of above ground live dry biomass and standing carbon stock for the lower 48 United States.

* The accompanying dataset was produced as part of a project funded under NASA’s Terrestrial Ecology Program and titled “The National Biomass and Carbon Dataset 2000 (NBCD 2000): A High Spatial Resolution Baseline to Reduce Uncertainty in Carbon Accounting and Flux Modeling.” The main objective of the project was to generate a high-resolution (30 m), year-2000 baseline estimate of basal area-weighted canopy height, aboveground live dry biomass, and standing carbon stock for the conterminous (lower 48) United States. Development of the dataset is based on an empirical modeling approach that combines USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data with high-resolution InSAR data acquired from the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and optical remote sensing data acquired from the Landsat ETM+ sensor. Three-season Landsat ETM+ data were systematically compiled by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) between 1999 and 2002 for the entire U.S. and were the foundation for development of both the USGS National Land Cover Dataset 2001 (NLCD 2001) and the Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools Project (LANDFIRE). Products from both the NLCD 2001 (landcover and canopy density) and LANDFIRE (existing vegetation type) projects as well as topographic information from the USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) are used within the NBCD 2000 project as spatial predictor layers for canopy height and biomass estimation. Forest survey data provided by the USDA Forest Service FIA program were made available to the project under a national Memorandum of Understanding. The response variables (canopy height and biomass) used in model development and validation were derived from the FIA database (FIADB). Production of the NLCD 2001 and LANDFIRE projects was based on a mapping zone approach in which the conterminous U.S. is split into 66 ecoregionally distinct mapping zones. This mapping zone approach was also adopted by the NBCD 2000 project. 

* Biomass 30m resolution. Digital numbers are in megagrams (Mg) of Aboveground Live Woody Biomass per Hectare (Mg/Ha)

#####Healthy Food Outlets PAA
* That would be really interesting and perhaps with buffers or kernel densities we could answer/investigate whether the lasso subset selection differently identifies significant characteristics/interactions based on the different spatial measures of food access, and verify/measure improvements in model predictive accuracy. David

* On Thu, Sep 25, 2014 at 1:52 PM, Lovasi, Gina S. 
I think that would be great.  Maybe we could even animate a series of kernel density surfaces across the years?  Anyway, fingers crossed.

1) Wrapped up ATN Aidsvu new data incorporation and data dictionary updates

The pre-2014-09 file only had 274 ZIP code to AIDSVu ZIP’s matches (AIDSVu uses ZCTA 2010). 224 new records now have AIDSVu ZIP level data. 498 ATN ZIP Codes matched an AIDSVu ZIP (AIDSVu uses ZCTA 2010).

2) Sent kathy the 2km buffers for transit and the distance variables. 

3) Need to reply to Vijay for MSM

Complicated enough to have access to their data. 

craft email for MSM and then forward to Andrew before sending to Vijay. 

Add in the latest GPS data with older summer data. 

Ask students which phones they have. 



Getting Addresses from Jose Luchsinger and Dana March.
EPA and NIMHD

M2M

how many respondents per tract? 

or how many respondents per UHF?

Tell M2M that bader is going to look at the distribution of the data.

The initial idea is to creat a krigged surface of self reported safety (a surface for each subject minus their actual point)

figure out how clustered the sample. 

get James' status maps. by neighborhood tabulation areas. 




WIC document. 


Transit
Station buffer - what would be the buffers.

*******Check time of crash accident from Crash Stat data.*********

Also, here is an updated Tree Canopy (pct of roadbed/sidewalk covered in tree canopy in census block (shared street boundary) of at least 1000 feet) Walk map. I’ll need to remove islands (particularly Rikers :) and perhaps places X distance from any Subway Station before the final selection.
http://cdb.io/1zYHBWd

Some things to consider for discussion tomorrow for Tree and Building walks. 

1) Do we want the students to walk down each segment once or twice? (Joe did two of each).

2) Do we want to randomly select across all boroughs or select within proximity of Columbia/Univ.?
Trees and Manhattan and the Bronx. 

3) How many walks? 
20
4) Include/Remove parks? (we discussed removing parks for high/low building walks but not for tree canopy).
Remove streets adjacent to parks. 

Lastly, I was contacted by a Geography major senior at New Paltz (Roz from ISERP’s younger brother-in-law) about possibly working for BEH. He might be able to be leveraged for some GPS work and possibly some GIS work. I spoke with him on the phone before my vacation. Attached is his resume.

GIS Plate
1) Any update with the COHD data I was supposed to receive from Luchsinger and March? 
2) Planning on getting data from Kathy at the end of this week. 
3) I'll be out on vacation on Friday - wedding in Kansas City. Heard to test out the wifi and the BBQ. 
4) Intern from SUNY New Paltz


Horizon
1) Estimating traffic across NYC, not sure if this is falling in James' queue or mine or where we stand on it. 
2) Registering for Probability and Stats in the fall (teacher: John Cunningham from Stats)

1) Roz former ISERP younger brother looking for GIS internship/work for this summer

2) Einsten NETS food environment NYC 2010 Food Env.
Is this done?: sent Tanya the pop dens. tract vars for the 23 counties

3) I’m off 4 of the next 9 days so I’ll be a little touch and go.

4) This week - started refining the building and tree canopy based walks from the maps I sent out. Have to re-write some tree based stuff b/c intersects not working. Shouldn’t be a problem, just threw too much at ArcGIS.

5) Other stuff on my plate includes; Kathy’s Transit projects, revisiting some of the kernel density metrics

6) Review Tanya’s NETS methods paper.

7) Stuff on the horizon, Steve’s traffic counts for NYC. 

8) Any update with the COHD data I was supposed to receive from Luchsinger and March?
