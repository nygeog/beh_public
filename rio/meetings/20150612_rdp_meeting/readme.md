1. Create 2-3 mapped visualizations of systematic social observation data from fulcrum.	
	* line segments for points.  
	* 5 maps
	* 1a - 5 maps with points
	* 1b - 5 maps with street segments
	* elevation - look for elevation data. 2. Clean GPX data to create tabular data for each participant that 		* includes number of recorded points, 	* number of days with any points, 
	* size of convex hull traveled within RdP (following methods developed during PATS analyses), 
	* % of time estimated to have been spent outside of RdP boundaries.
	* distance from home for each point
	* snap to grid point for home. 
3. Generate 2-3 map visualizations that protect confidentiality of individual subjects while illustrating the contrasting mobility patterns observed.
	* do it from nucleo as the home. 
	
	
	
RdP GIS Scope of WorkSummer 2015(1) Create (or support the creation of) 2-5 mapped visualizations of systematic social observation data from the 646 street observations captured through fulcrum.  I imagine something like a smaller version of the journal of maps physical disorder, incorporating illustrative geotagged photos.  For example, goals of these maps could be to illustrate a spatial pattern in water/soil stability related problems, or to spotlight commercial resources including produce access.(2) Create tabular data and corresponding data dictionary for each participant that includes number of recorded points, number of days with any points, size of convex hull traveled within RdP (following methods developed during PATS analyses), % of time estimated to have been spent outside of RdP boundaries.  I would also like to include in the tabular data variables derived from fulcrum, which I believe would benefit from further discussion among the group in regards to operationalization.(3) Generate 2-4 map visualizations that protect confidentiality of individual subjects while illustrating the contrasting mobility patterns observed. (4) Lead or inform our process to finalize digitization of area boundaries and streets, incorporating corrections noted in the field.
