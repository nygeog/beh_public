#RdP GIS Scope of Work##To Do####Interim support of field data collection in RdP
1. Review of initial GPX files from DG-100 devices, and participation in discussion of threshold for re-deployment of devices based on inadequate number of recorded points.

	* threshold for redeployment? Look at the batch of things so far and set a criteria.2. Development of maps to display travel patterns for 15-30 individuals scheduled to participate in an in depth qualitative interview that will include discussion of mobility patterns.	* delivery format? Paper format. 120 maps 30 * 4 = 120 maps. Deborah Castigiani. See if she has ArcPy for mapping module experience. 		* map detail? (participants who travel far will have less detail, might need map panels, or (local) interactive map), QGIS or Python or something. 	* for every day we want an RdP only map, if they go beyond, have a Rio city-wide scale.
	* we need to modify the streetname dataset. for corrections/errors. 
	* Date for Qualitative. Two weeks. Rolling with the Waves of data. 
	* Data format - PDF. One page per day. 
	
	* Labels - every hour or so label points so we have timestamps.		* For the mapping output. 30-50 edits/additions to Street Names. Think about about this process, the best way to streamline this. 

####Additional Street Audits

* When are these happening? 
* I have some tasks to update our data collection. 
* Blogpost for Fulcrum. 

* Talking about photos per question. Editing questions. 
	####Geoprocessing of returned GPX (DG-100) and fulcrum data1. Create 2-3 mapped visualizations of systematic social observation data from fulcrum.2. Clean GPX data to create tabular data for each participant that 		* includes number of recorded points, 	* number of days with any points, 
	* size of convex hull traveled within RdP (following methods developed during PATS analyses), 
	* % of time estimated to have been spent outside of RdP boundaries.3. Generate 2-3 map visualizations that protect confidentiality of individual subjects while illustrating the contrasting mobility patterns observed.






###Andrew's comments:	
Ongoing QC look at the files.
Maps created to support the Qualitative interviews.

##Completed####Preparation for GPS deployment1. Selecting structured walks for GPS device testing, supporting users in software issues.2. Mapping results of structured walks for exploration of how building bulk and tree canopy may contribute to multipath error.####Preparation for field data collection in RdP1. Supporting device selection and corresponding training materials development.2. Informing purchase of satellite imagery and reviewing digitization of area boundaries.3. Creation of a grid on which to base our sampling of residential buildings.4. Set up and revision of an app in Fulcrum to facilitate systematic social observation and archiving of geotagged photos.5. Participation in discussions of study design and necessary confidentiality protections, including secure transfer of geographically identifying data.
