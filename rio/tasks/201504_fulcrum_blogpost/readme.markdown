##Summary

Rio das Pedras (RdP) is the third largest informal community in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Home to approximately 63,500 residents, residents of RdP bear unique health challenges. Aggravated by seasonal flooding, vehicle traffic, improvised construction methods, and limited waste disposal, the limited access to municipal services and transportation likely predispose residents to injury and poor health. However, limited data exists that can accurately characterize the health of residents of RdP, and fewer data that can point out areas of intervention that have high return on investment (ROI) potential. As a result, little is known regarding the existing health risks and behaviors in Rdp. The [Built Environment and Health Research Group at Columbia University (BEH)](http://beh.columbia.edu/) is undertaking a [Community Needs Assessment for the Rio das Pedras area.](http://beh.columbia.edu/2014/07/25/rio-das-pedras-community-needs-assessment/)

Led by [Dr. Gina Lovasi](http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/our-faculty/profile?uni=gl2225), we have teamed up with an interdisciplinary group of global experts to perform an initial community needs assessment in Rio das Pedras, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to assess the feasibility of large scale data collection on health, mobility, and the microbiome in these settings.

##Discovering Fulcrum
Our research require us to assemble both pre-existing geographic data while also collecting observational data on neighborhood characteristics and conditions for certain studies. [Dr. Andrew Rundle](http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/our-faculty/profile?uni=agr3), [Dr. Michael Bader](http://mikebader.net/), PhD Candidate [Steve Mooney](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Sd7opuwAAAAJ&hl=en) and others in the BEH Research Group developed a [Virtual Street Audit Tool using Google Street View named CANVAS](http://beh.columbia.edu/2015/01/05/new-research-using-google-street-view-to-conduct-neighborhood-virtual-audits/). Unfortunately, Street View was not available in RdP. So we shelved the idea of collected neighborhood conditions data.  

While the initial phases of the project involved planning out data collection via GPS tracking and study participant interviews, we were considering other ways to scout and recruit study participants as well as collect data and photos documenting the built environment. Then [Senior GIS Analyst Daniel M. Sheehan](http://nygeog.github.io/) was reading a [CartoDB blogpost about using Fulcrum](http://docs.cartodb.com/tutorials/data_collection_fulcrum.html) and realized that [Fulcrum](http://fulcrumapp.com/) might be the best tool for collecting that data in the field and also enabled the field team to collect neighborhood conditions data in-person with Fulcrum. The BEH group developed a custom form with the Fulcrum App to help collect that data. 

We did our first round of data collection in March 2015. And the field team is gearing up to be out in the field again this May. We were able to create a new modified Fulcrum App and also add our own [Map Layers](http://fulcrumapp.com/help/adding-layers/).

##Notes from the field
Project Manager, Garazi Zulaika: 

Fulcrum hugely facilitated data collection in the field. The Fulcrum's fast synchronization allowed us to communicate in real time and field test our data collection questions with collaborators in different countries.  Fulcrum’s ability to store multiple entry points and photos allowed us to collect data throughout the entire day without accessing any internet prior to leaving the field. Another tool that was extremely useful was the Fulcrum's ability to pan away from the location set by the device’s GPS. Given our data collection is ongoing in a large informal community with informal construction methods that lead to building canyons and poor satellite reception, the ability to change the location of the device by a block or a street hugely improved the accuracy of the data being collected. We found that certain mobile devices had extremely accurate GPS locators while older devices had a harder time correctly identifying the users location. The user friendly platform allowed data collectors to tailor the questions to fit our needs in incorporating context specific questions, modifying the answer categories, adding and deleting items, and going back and editing the responses even after the entry had been completed. The Fulcrum App did not force us to answer questions in order which allowed us to mark things as we came across them while moving through the informal community. Fulcrum’s flexibility was extremely valuable and allowed us to collect data extremely efficiently and quickly. I look forward to using it again in the field!
